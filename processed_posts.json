As of FY2023, the GCC landscape in India has swelled to over 1,580 centres, boasting a market size of $46 billion with a workforce crossing 1.66 million.\n\n\ud83d\udc4dAt least 125 of the Fortune 500 enterprises have their GCCs in India. Currently 70% of these GCCs are US and Canadian companies. However, large non-American multinational companies will drive the next phase of the growth of the GCCs in India. Businesses headquartered in Japan, Australia, UK and Europe are eyeing India as the country gradually becomes a premier destination for offshore centres, they added.\n\n\ud83d\udc4dAs per a recent survey by ANSR, Bengaluru and Hyderabad have solidified their presence in GCCs with 30% and 19%, respectively followed by Delhi 15%, Mumbai 12%, Pune 10%, and Chennai 9%. Additionally, nearly 80% of GCCs are directing their focus on AI, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics.\n\n\ud83d\udc4dAccording to a nasscom-Zinnov report, by 2025, India is poised to have 1,900 GCCs with the market size touching $60 billion.

But then, something caught my eye. An elderly man sitting quietly on a chair with his wife. My heart skipped a beat\u2014it was Naru Sir.\n\nBefore I could even process it, I received a call from customer care: all flights were canceled. It could be evening or tomorrow before we could fly. I walked over to Naru Sir, told him there was no point waiting, and suggested he leave because of the cancellation. He looked at me, confused, and asked, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\n\nI smiled and said, \u2018Sir, you are the reason I\u2019m a global trainer today.\u2019 His face lit up, but he asked, \u2018How?\u2019 I told him how, back in 2012, I was speaking at a conference at TiE Chennai. He was in the audience, and after my talk, he hired me as a corporate trainer for his company, Xcode Life Sciences. He then recommended me to MSL India, where I trained employees across the country. That led to opportunities with Times of India and many more.\n\nWith tears in my eyes, I said, \u2018Sir, it\u2019s all because of you. You believed in me when I was just starting out. I\u2019m so grateful.\u2019 His wife touched my forehead and said, \u2018God bless you. You\u2019re going to achieve even greater things.\u2019\n\nBut then Naru Sir shared something with me that left me speechless. He said, \u2018Since that time, I\u2019ve lost 25% vision in both my eyes, I had a stroke, and a heart attack. But seeing you do so well... it makes me so happy.\u2019\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if he would even remember me, so I showed him a testimonial he had written for me on LinkedIn back in 2012. The smile on his face said it all.\n\nGrateful beyond words for a mentor, a godfather, who saw potential in me long before I saw it in myself. \ud83d\ude4f Naru Narayanan",

So, we decided to take a leap of faith. As a surprise, we offered to create a video ad in-house, completely free of charge and included it in their campaigns.\n\nThe results were nothing short of extraordinary. The video outperformed expectations, delivering the best campaign results the brand had ever seen. It not only improved their ROAS but also sparked a transformation in their growth journey.\n\nOver time, the brand's audience began actively searching for them using branded keywords\u2014a clear sign of growing recognition and loyalty. Their marketing budget? It\u2019s now grown 20X, thanks to consistent returns and a relationship built on trust and results.\n\nThis journey taught us an important lesson: sometimes, to help our clients succeed, we need to go the extra mile\u2014even if it means taking risks or offering something for free.\n\nIn the agency business, working with a client is more than a partnership; it\u2019s almost like a professional marriage. Their success is our success, and their growth is the ultimate reward.\n\nWhen you believe in a brand\u2019s potential, take that leap. Because sometimes, one bold step can change the trajectory of a business\u2014and yours too.",

And yes, we have a fancy 5000 sqft office in Mumbai but all of this was done with company\u2019s profits. Our investor\u2019s money of \u20b910 Crores is currently invested in an FD earning 8.5% interest :) We have almost 85,000 active paying customers and are working on new financial products and services some of which are already launched and have also achieved profitability.\n\nSo why did we layoff?\n\nI started this company from my bedroom with just 5 interns 2 years back and fast forward today we have almost 200 employees. Needless to say, when you grow at such lightening speed you are bound to make some mistakes with hiring and redundant expenses. This is our first cost cutting excercise since inception. We have identified significant AI driven cost savings that can boost profitability and efficiency which can be reinvested in the business growth. Raghav Gupta and I have been running this company bootstrapped without ever using investor capital because we are super strict with our financial planning and diligence.\n\nWhile I don the hat of a capitalistic businessman continually growing the company I also realise the psychological impact on the laid off employees. Please note that we have offered a healthy severance package depending on the tenure to all the laid off employees and continue to support them with getting employed in my peer\u2019s companies.\n\nThank you everyone and good night",

I cannot speak for the whole world, but as a teacher, I can say that technology is one of our greatest enablers.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f With generative AI like ChatGPT, teachers now have the power to create and customize teaching material. Not only does this save time, but it also allows them to focus on what really matters - explaining concepts and ensuring students understand them. And let's not forget that technology is not a substitute for teaching. We still need experienced teachers to evaluate the output of hashtag#chatgpt and to provide the human touch that machines cannot replicate.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Tech has undoubtedly transformed the landscape of education. One of the most exciting developments is the emergence of one-to-many personalized learning, which allows us to create a unique and engaging learning experience that caters to each student's individual needs. That is exactly how the 25,000 teachers of BYJU'S are able to teach millions of students around the world.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f No technology, no matter how great, can be flawless. We have to make sure our students do not become overly reliant on technology, as this could have negative consequences for their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It's important to strike a balance between using technology as a tool to enhance learning and ensuring students are still actively engaged in the learning process.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f The pandemic accelerated the adoption of EdTech, prompting us to explore new ways of teaching and learning. It's becoming increasingly clear now that the future of education lies in hybrid learning. By combining the best of both traditional and tech-enabled learning methods, hybrid learning allows us to offer a more personalized and flexible approach to education.\n\nNo advancement in tech can ever replace the impact of a single dedicated teacher. The relationships we build with our students, the empathy we show, and the personal attention we provide cannot be replicated by machines.\n\nSo, let's continue to explore the endless possibilities of generative AI, but let's do so with a deep appreciation for the unique role that teachers play in shaping the lives of their students.\n\nTechnology is, was, and will always play a supporting role. Teachers were, are, and will always be education\u2019s heart and soul.\n\nPS: The AI-generated image I have used here has been created using Dall-E-2\n\nhashtag#technology hashtag#ai hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#enablers",

Did you ever see them as just bedtime stories? I think they\u2019re much more than that. They hold wisdom passed down through generations, wrapped in the adventures of animals. As we go through our careers, it\u2019s interesting how these old fables still matter. Let\u2019s take a moment to reflect on how these lessons influence our personal and professional lives. And to show you what I mean, let me share a story. Here we go!\n\nThe Tale of the Blue Grass\n\nOnce upon a time (yes, we're starting like that! \ud83d\ude09), there was a donkey and a tiger. The donkey looked at the grass and declared, \"The grass is blue!\"\n\nThe tiger, surprised, replied, \"No, the grass is clearly green.\"\n\nThis led to a heated argument, and they decided to take their dispute to the lion king for resolution.\n\nAs they approached the lion's throne, the donkey shouted, \"Your Highness, isn't it true that the grass is blue?\"\n\nThe lion calmly replied, \"Yes, the grass is blue.\"\n\nThe donkey jumped with joy and continued, \"The tiger disagrees with me and annoys me. Please punish him!\"\n\nThe lion declared, \"The tiger will be punished with 5 years of silence.\"\n\nThe donkey happily trotted away, repeating, \"The grass is blue!\"\n\nThe tiger, accepting his punishment, asked the lion, \"Your Majesty, why have you punished me? The grass is indeed green.\"\n\nThe lion smiled and replied, \"Yes, the grass is green.\"\n\nConfused, the tiger asked, \"Then why punish me?\"\n\nThe lion's response was profound: \"The punishment has nothing to do with whether the grass is blue or green. It's because it's unthinkable for a brave, intelligent creature like you to waste time arguing with a donkey, and on top of that, to come and bother me with that question.\"\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s about staying patient, planning ahead, and carefully choosing which battles are worth fighting.\n\nI'd love to hear your \"blue grass\" stories and the lessons you've learned.

Employs 27,000 girls ( till now over a million girls) have worked in KPR Mills, you have to go there to see how he provides education, nutritious food, meditation and so much more to the girls who were otherwise in families that treated them as liabilities in Bihar, UP, Orissa and Assam.\n\nAnd most of you, will understand what I am talking about - the eastern part of our country, and the condition of girls there.\n\n2. The thousands of girls I met had a sense of pride which can bring tears to your eyes and confidence that brings pure joy.\n\n3. He also gives them an opportunity to move out of mill work to fast track career opportunities through higher-education, so they learn while they earn and move on to work in companies like Infosys etc.\n\n4. He has also planted more than 2.5 lakh trees in Coimbatore to create an environment where one wants to live and breathe.\n\nThere is so much more to this STORY, watch my full video interaction with Mr. KPR on YouTube.\n\nI believe entrepreneurs like him deserve Padma Bhushan.

They were the outflow of the heart\u2019s blood of one of the greatest sons of God, who have ever come to this world of ours; words which came as the fruit of realisation, from a man who had felt and realised God Himself; who had spoken with God, lived with God.\u201d\n\nSay to your own minds, I am He, I am He. Let it ring day and night in your minds like a song, and at the point of death declare : I am He. That is truth; the infinite strength of the world is yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, I can do everything. Even if poison of a snake is powerless if you can firmly deny it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, this misery that I am suffering is of my own doing, and that very thing proves that it will have to be undone by me alone. That which I created, I can demolish; that which is created by someone else I shall never be able to destroy.\nTherefore, stand up, be bold, and be strong. Take the whole responsibility on your own shoulders, and know that you are the creator of your own destiny.\u201d",
