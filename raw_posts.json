As of FY2023, the GCC landscape in India has swelled to over 1,580 centres, boasting a market size of $46 billion with a workforce crossing 1.66 million.\n\n👍At least 125 of the Fortune 500 enterprises have their GCCs in India. Currently 70% of these GCCs are US and Canadian companies. However, large non-American multinational companies will drive the next phase of the growth of the GCCs in India. Businesses headquartered in Japan, Australia, UK and Europe are eyeing India as the country gradually becomes a premier destination for offshore centres, they added.\n\n👍As per a recent survey by ANSR, Bengaluru and Hyderabad have solidified their presence in GCCs with 30% and 19%, respectively followed by Delhi 15%, Mumbai 12%, Pune 10%, and Chennai 9%. Additionally, nearly 80% of GCCs are directing their focus on AI, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics.\n\n👍According to a nasscom-Zinnov report, by 2025, India is poised to have 1,900 GCCs with the market size touching $60 billion. This market opportunity is expected to surge to $110 billion by 2030.\n\nWe had the wonderful opportunity to discuss the above and more during the nasscom Executive Council meeting at the #SAPLabsIndia campus in Bangalore.

But then, something caught my eye. An elderly man sitting quietly on a chair with his wife. My heart skipped a beat—it was Naru Sir.\n\nBefore I could even process it, I received a call from customer care: all flights were canceled. It could be evening or tomorrow before we could fly. I walked over to Naru Sir, told him there was no point waiting, and suggested he leave because of the cancellation. He looked at me, confused, and asked, ‘Who are you?’\n\nI smiled and said, ‘Sir, you are the reason I’m a global trainer today.’ His face lit up, but he asked, ‘How?’ I told him how, back in 2012, I was speaking at a conference at TiE Chennai. He was in the audience, and after my talk, he hired me as a corporate trainer for his company, Xcode Life Sciences. He then recommended me to MSL India, where I trained employees across the country. That led to opportunities with Times of India and many more.\n\nWith tears in my eyes, I said, ‘Sir, it’s all because of you. You believed in me when I was just starting out. I’m so grateful.’ His wife touched my forehead and said, ‘God bless you. You’re going to achieve even greater things.’\n\nBut then Naru Sir shared something with me that left me speechless. He said, ‘Since that time, I’ve lost 25% vision in both my eyes, I had a stroke, and a heart attack. But seeing you do so well... it makes me so happy.’\n\nI wasn’t sure if he would even remember me, so I showed him a testimonial he had written for me on LinkedIn back in 2012. The smile on his face said it all.\n\nGrateful beyond words for a mentor, a godfather, who saw potential in me long before I saw it in myself. 🙏 Naru Narayanan",

        "text": "From Hesitation to 20X Growth: A Story of Going the Extra Mile\n\nFive years ago, we started working with a D2C brand that had an initial marketing budget of just ₹50,000 per month.\n\nLike many emerging businesses, they were cautious with their spending, especially when it came to video ads—which they felt were too expensive.\n\nDespite their hesitation, we believed in the power of video to drive engagement and conversions. So, we decided to take a leap of faith. As a surprise, we offered to create a video ad in-house, completely free of charge and included it in their campaigns.\n\nThe results were nothing short of extraordinary. The video outperformed expectations, delivering the best campaign results the brand had ever seen. It not only improved their ROAS but also sparked a transformation in their growth journey.\n\nOver time, the brand's audience began actively searching for them using branded keywords—a clear sign of growing recognition and loyalty. Their marketing budget? It’s now grown 20X, thanks to consistent returns and a relationship built on trust and results.\n\nThis journey taught us an important lesson: sometimes, to help our clients succeed, we need to go the extra mile—even if it means taking risks or offering something for free.\n\nIn the agency business, working with a client is more than a partnership; it’s almost like a professional marriage. Their success is our success, and their growth is the ultimate reward.\n\nWhen you believe in a brand’s potential, take that leap. Because sometimes, one bold step can change the trajectory of a business—and yours too.",

As a finance influencer who built his career around financial education, the irony isn’t lost on me :) So let me give you guys an update- it’s been a while.\n\nBusiness update: We are currently doing around $8Mn of annualised revenue with a 35-40% EBITDA. And yes, we have a fancy 5000 sqft office in Mumbai but all of this was done with company’s profits. Our investor’s money of ₹10 Crores is currently invested in an FD earning 8.5% interest :) We have almost 85,000 active paying customers and are working on new financial products and services some of which are already launched and have also achieved profitability.\n\nSo why did we layoff?\n\nI started this company from my bedroom with just 5 interns 2 years back and fast forward today we have almost 200 employees. Needless to say, when you grow at such lightening speed you are bound to make some mistakes with hiring and redundant expenses. This is our first cost cutting excercise since inception. We have identified significant AI driven cost savings that can boost profitability and efficiency which can be reinvested in the business growth. Raghav Gupta and I have been running this company bootstrapped without ever using investor capital because we are super strict with our financial planning and diligence.\n\nWhile I don the hat of a capitalistic businessman continually growing the company I also realise the psychological impact on the laid off employees. Please note that we have offered a healthy severance package depending on the tenure to all the laid off employees and continue to support them with getting employed in my peer’s companies.\n\nThank you everyone and good night",

        "text": "Every industry everywhere is currently debating the role of technology. I cannot speak for the whole world, but as a teacher, I can say that technology is one of our greatest enablers.\n\n⭐️ With generative AI like ChatGPT, teachers now have the power to create and customize teaching material. Not only does this save time, but it also allows them to focus on what really matters - explaining concepts and ensuring students understand them. And let's not forget that technology is not a substitute for teaching. We still need experienced teachers to evaluate the output of hashtag#chatgpt and to provide the human touch that machines cannot replicate.\n\n⭐️ Tech has undoubtedly transformed the landscape of education. One of the most exciting developments is the emergence of one-to-many personalized learning, which allows us to create a unique and engaging learning experience that caters to each student's individual needs. That is exactly how the 25,000 teachers of BYJU'S are able to teach millions of students around the world.\n\n⭐️ No technology, no matter how great, can be flawless. We have to make sure our students do not become overly reliant on technology, as this could have negative consequences for their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It's important to strike a balance between using technology as a tool to enhance learning and ensuring students are still actively engaged in the learning process.\n\n⭐️ The pandemic accelerated the adoption of EdTech, prompting us to explore new ways of teaching and learning. It's becoming increasingly clear now that the future of education lies in hybrid learning. By combining the best of both traditional and tech-enabled learning methods, hybrid learning allows us to offer a more personalized and flexible approach to education.\n\nNo advancement in tech can ever replace the impact of a single dedicated teacher. The relationships we build with our students, the empathy we show, and the personal attention we provide cannot be replicated by machines.\n\nSo, let's continue to explore the endless possibilities of generative AI, but let's do so with a deep appreciation for the unique role that teachers play in shaping the lives of their students.\n\nTechnology is, was, and will always play a supporting role. Teachers were, are, and will always be education’s heart and soul.\n\nPS: The AI-generated image I have used here has been created using Dall-E-2\n\nhashtag#technology hashtag#ai hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#enablers",

        "text": "Today, I was chatting with my team about some classic stories, and it got me thinking. 🤔\n\nRemember those Panchatantra tales we grew up with? Did you ever see them as just bedtime stories? I think they’re much more than that. They hold wisdom passed down through generations, wrapped in the adventures of animals. As we go through our careers, it’s interesting how these old fables still matter. Let’s take a moment to reflect on how these lessons influence our personal and professional lives. And to show you what I mean, let me share a story. Here we go!\n\nThe Tale of the Blue Grass\n\nOnce upon a time (yes, we're starting like that! 😉), there was a donkey and a tiger. The donkey looked at the grass and declared, \"The grass is blue!\"\n\nThe tiger, surprised, replied, \"No, the grass is clearly green.\"\n\nThis led to a heated argument, and they decided to take their dispute to the lion king for resolution.\n\nAs they approached the lion's throne, the donkey shouted, \"Your Highness, isn't it true that the grass is blue?\"\n\nThe lion calmly replied, \"Yes, the grass is blue.\"\n\nThe donkey jumped with joy and continued, \"The tiger disagrees with me and annoys me. Please punish him!\"\n\nThe lion declared, \"The tiger will be punished with 5 years of silence.\"\n\nThe donkey happily trotted away, repeating, \"The grass is blue!\"\n\nThe tiger, accepting his punishment, asked the lion, \"Your Majesty, why have you punished me? The grass is indeed green.\"\n\nThe lion smiled and replied, \"Yes, the grass is green.\"\n\nConfused, the tiger asked, \"Then why punish me?\"\n\nThe lion's response was profound: \"The punishment has nothing to do with whether the grass is blue or green. It's because it's unthinkable for a brave, intelligent creature like you to waste time arguing with a donkey, and on top of that, to come and bother me with that question.\"\n\nAll in all, it’s about staying patient, planning ahead, and carefully choosing which battles are worth fighting.\n\nI'd love to hear your \"blue grass\" stories and the lessons you've learned. Share your experience in the comments!\n\nhashtag#CARachanaRanade hashtag#StockMarket hashtag#ShareMarket hashtag#Finance hashtag#Knowledge hashtag#Childhoodstories hashtag#lessons",

On one side we keep talking and admiring the startups on other are businesses like KPR Mills, which have a market cap of close to 30,000 crores and employees 27000 girls.\n\nWhat I loved about Mr. KPR - comes from a village and built the mill in Coimbatore, which today exports to 68 countries, and brands like Walmart, H&M, Marks and Spencers and you name it.\n\nBut what sets him apart -\n\n1. Employs 27,000 girls ( till now over a million girls) have worked in KPR Mills, you have to go there to see how he provides education, nutritious food, meditation and so much more to the girls who were otherwise in families that treated them as liabilities in Bihar, UP, Orissa and Assam.\n\nAnd most of you, will understand what I am talking about - the eastern part of our country, and the condition of girls there.\n\n2. The thousands of girls I met had a sense of pride which can bring tears to your eyes and confidence that brings pure joy.\n\n3. He also gives them an opportunity to move out of mill work to fast track career opportunities through higher-education, so they learn while they earn and move on to work in companies like Infosys etc.\n\n4. He has also planted more than 2.5 lakh trees in Coimbatore to create an environment where one wants to live and breathe.\n\nThere is so much more to this STORY, watch my full video interaction with Mr. KPR on YouTube.\n\nI believe entrepreneurs like him deserve Padma Bhushan. And it's stories like these that we need to amplify and keep talking about for younger generation to follow.",

Whenever you feel a little low, keep them with you; they do come in very handy.\nPutting here with lots of love that may we all be peaceful and happy.\n\n“Things don’t grow better; they remain as they are. It is we who grow better, by the changes we make in ourselves.”\n\n“Things that used to make me miserable when I was a child, don’t do so now. The subject changed, so the object was bound to change; so says the Vedanta.”\n\n“It is a weakness to think that any one is dependent on me, and that I can do well to another. This belief is the mother of all our attachment, and through this attachment comes all our pain.”\n\n“It is the coward and the fool who says, ‘This is fate’—so says the Sanskrit proverb. But it is the strong man who stands up and says, I will make my fate.”\n\n“Our mistakes have places here. Go on! Don’t look back if you think you have done something that is not right. Now, do you believe you could be what you are today, had you not made those mistakes before? Bless your mistakes, then. They have been angels unawares. Blessed be torture! Blessed be happiness!”\n\n“We find ourselves in the position for which we are fit, each ball finds its own hole; and if one has some capacity above another, the world will find that out too, in this universal adjusting that goes on. So it is no use to grumble... what is the use of fighting and complaining? That will not help us to better things.”\n\n“The remedy for weakness is not brooding over weakness, but thinking of strength.”\n\n“We have to bear the result of our own actions because we attach ourselves to them.”\n\nRemember the words of Christ—Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. These words are literally true, not figures or fiction. They were the outflow of the heart’s blood of one of the greatest sons of God, who have ever come to this world of ours; words which came as the fruit of realisation, from a man who had felt and realised God Himself; who had spoken with God, lived with God.”\n\nSay to your own minds, I am He, I am He. Let it ring day and night in your minds like a song, and at the point of death declare : I am He. That is truth; the infinite strength of the world is yours.”\n\n“Say, I can do everything. Even if poison of a snake is powerless if you can firmly deny it.”\n\n“Say, this misery that I am suffering is of my own doing, and that very thing proves that it will have to be undone by me alone. That which I created, I can demolish; that which is created by someone else I shall never be able to destroy.\nTherefore, stand up, be bold, and be strong. Take the whole responsibility on your own shoulders, and know that you are the creator of your own destiny.”",
